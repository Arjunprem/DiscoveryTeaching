**Product**: Discovery Teaching (formerly - TeachBack and The Affective Tutor)

**Summary**: An in-class web and mobile application providing an efficient standard platform for students and instructors to actively engage and interact about class materials, the learning, and teaching processes.

“Discovery Teaching” is an in-class web application providing an efficient standard platform for students and instructors to actively engage and interact during learning and teaching activities in the class. The application and this study are part of the research of [Prof. William Tarimo](mailto:wtarimo@conncoll.edu) and [Prof. Timothy Hickey](mailto:tjhickey@brandeis.edu), of the Computer Science departments at Connecticut College and Brandeis University, respectively. Through the use of Discovery Teaching in the classroom and with appropriate pedagogies, we believe that students learn more effectively in large classes when they are engaged using the interactive tools provided in the application. This research will help us better understand the underlying pedagogical mechanisms of such systems which contribute to improved learning and teaching outcomes.
